# put here things that you don't want to get installed
# you can safely include these if you want:
# syshud
# wofimoji
# wofi-calc
# flameshot
# nwg-look
# qt6ct
# qt5ct
# thunar
# gvfs
# wiremix
# gpu-screen-recorder-gtk
# neovim
# swayimg
# breeze
# breeze5"
# catppuccin-gtk-theme-mocha
# catppuccin-qt5ct-git
# papirus-icon-theme-git
# rose-pine-hyprcursor
# network-manager-applet
# wlogout
# you won't have much functionality but the hyprland part will work just fine. Also syshud is recommended to ignore if you want to have as much ram as possible.
# Put what you want to ignore below (or anywhere you want without a comment (#)), in one line, ex: waybar gpu-screen-recorder-gtk wlogout
