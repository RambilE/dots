# dots
Configs for different thing because i can

This repository consists of my created dots from my pc and laptop and has them separated in different directories, and a global one

# list of software to use this with
vim
hyprland
bash
hyprpaper
wofi
ranger (coming soom trademark)
rofi-wayland or other launcher idk

# folder navigation
Folders that are not "global" are more like an archive

# todo
config for wlogout, separate hyprland config into different files, maybe add a script that'll autoinstall everything i need
